# CorDapp Template - Java

Welcome to the Java CorDapp template. The CorDapp template is a stubbed-out CorDapp that you can use to bootstrap 
your own CorDapps.

# Pre-Requisites

See https://docs.corda.net/getting-set-up.html.

# Usage

## Running tests inside IntelliJ
	
We recommend editing your IntelliJ preferences so that you use the Gradle runner - this means that the quasar utils
plugin will make sure that some flags (like ``-javaagent`` - see below) are
set for you.

To switch to using the Gradle runner:

* Navigate to ``Build, Execution, Deployment -> Build Tools -> Gradle -> Runner`` (or search for `runner`)
  * Windows: this is in "Settings"
  * MacOS: this is in "Preferences"
* Set "Delegate IDE build/run actions to gradle" to true
* Set "Run test using:" to "Gradle Test Runner"

If you would prefer to use the built in IntelliJ JUnit test runner, you can run ``gradlew installQuasar`` which will
copy your quasar JAR file to the lib directory. You will then need to specify ``-javaagent:lib/quasar.jar``
and set the run directory to the project root directory for each test.

## Running the nodes

See https://docs.corda.net/tutorial-cordapp.html#running-the-example-cordapp.

## Interacting with the nodes

### Shell

When started via the command line, each node will display an interactive shell:

    Welcome to the Corda interactive shell.
    Useful commands include 'help' to see what is available, and 'bye' to shut down the node.
    
    Tue Nov 06 11:58:13 GMT 2018>>>

You can use this shell to interact with your node. For example, enter `run networkMapSnapshot` to see a list of 
the other nodes on the network:

    Tue Nov 06 11:58:13 GMT 2018>>> run networkMapSnapshot
    [
      {
      "addresses" : [ "localhost:10002" ],
      "legalIdentitiesAndCerts" : [ "O=Notary, L=London, C=GB" ],
      "platformVersion" : 3,
      "serial" : 1541505484825
    },
      {
      "addresses" : [ "localhost:10005" ],
      "legalIdentitiesAndCerts" : [ "O=PartyA, L=London, C=GB" ],
      "platformVersion" : 3,
      "serial" : 1541505382560
    },
      {
      "addresses" : [ "localhost:10008" ],
      "legalIdentitiesAndCerts" : [ "O=PartyB, L=New York, C=US" ],
      "platformVersion" : 3,
      "serial" : 1541505384742
    }
    ]
    
    Tue Nov 06 12:30:11 GMT 2018>>> 

You can find out more about the node shell [here](https://docs.corda.net/shell.html).

### Client

`clients/src/main/java/com/template/Client.java` defines a simple command-line client that connects to a node via RPC 
and prints a list of the other nodes on the network.

#### Running the client

##### Via the command line

Run the `runTemplateClient` Gradle task. By default, it connects to the node with RPC address `localhost:10006` with 
the username `user1` and the password `test`.

##### Via IntelliJ

Run the `Run Template Client` run configuration. By default, it connects to the node with RPC address `localhost:10006` 
with the username `user1` and the password `test`.

### Webserver

`clients/src/main/java/com/template/webserver/` defines a simple Spring webserver that connects to a node via RPC and 
allows you to interact with the node over HTTP.

The API endpoints are defined here:

     clients/src/main/java/com/template/webserver/Controller.java

And a static webpage is defined here:

     clients/src/main/resources/static/

#### Running the webserver

##### Via the command line

Run the `runTemplateServer` Gradle task. By default, it connects to the node with RPC address `localhost:10006` with 
the username `user1` and the password `test`, and serves the webserver on port `localhost:10050`.

##### Via IntelliJ

Run the `Run Template Server` run configuration. By default, it connects to the node with RPC address `localhost:10006` 
with the username `user1` and the password `test`, and serves the webserver on port `localhost:10050`.

#### Interacting with the webserver

The static webpage is served on:

    http://localhost:10050

While the sole template endpoint is served on:

    http://localhost:10050/templateendpoint
    
# Extending the template

You should extend this template as follows:

* Add your own state and contract definitions under `contracts/src/main/java/`
* Add your own flow definitions under `workflows/src/main/java/`
* Extend or replace the client and webserver under `clients/src/main/java/`

For a guided example of how to extend this template, see the Hello, World! tutorial 
[here](https://docs.corda.net/hello-world-introduction.html).

# Abstract 
The population pertaining to the entire world has been increasing steadily over the past decades. One of the most basic requirements for the survival of humans is a shelter that could be anything from a small hut to a luxurious skyscraper, ultimately giving the construction industry a major role in this process. In comparison to many other industries, the construction industry can be termed as one of the worldâ€™s most fragmented sectors due to the scattered and complex supply chain. Furthermore, this complexity moves a step higher while keeping track of the various factors involved, like the clients, consultants, architects, engineers, main contractors, subcontractors, material suppliers, etc. Therefore, a massive amount of effort and resources are required for carrying out different activities like keeping track of the work progress, schedule, costs, and payments. Also, the complex supply chain of the globally manufactured construction products has to be managed for the sake of meeting the quality requirements and customer satisfaction. But the lack of accountability in the construction industry sometimes leads to various types of faults, delays, and even accidents at some stages. Keeping these main points in mind, this paper introduces a key to this dispute with the help of Corda, a distributed ledger platform for permissioned networks, inspired by blockchain technology. This helps in maintaining transparency amongst the actors involved in this industry, thus preventing any form of miscommunication.
